# LOOP PRACTICE – 35 QUESTIONS FOR COMPLETE MASTERY

## LEVEL 1 – BASICS AND RANGE
1. Print numbers from 1 to 10 using `for` and `range()`.
2. Print numbers from 10 to 1 using `range(start, stop, step)`.
3. Print every 2nd number from 2 to 20.
4. Print all even numbers between 1 and 40 using step size in `range()`.
5. Print the square of each number from 1 to 10.
6. Print each element and its index from `[10, 20, 30, 40]` using `enumerate()`.
7. Print all characters of `"Python Loops"` one by one.
8. Print only characters at even indices of `"Artificial Intelligence"`.
9. Reverse a list `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` manually using a loop.
10. Print numbers from `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` in reverse order using `range()`.

## LEVEL 2 – CONTROL FLOW AND CONDITIONS
11. Print numbers from 1–15 but skip 5 using `continue`.
12. Print numbers from 1–10 but stop when 7 is reached using `break`.
13. Use `for...else` to print `"Loop completed"` after finishing.
14. Count even and odd numbers in `[3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]`.
15. From `"AI2025@OpenAI"`, count digits, alphabets, and symbols using loops.
16. Count how many times `"a"` appears in `"bananas"` without using `count()`.
17. Print `"Fizz"` for multiples of 3, `"Buzz"` for multiples of 5, and `"FizzBuzz"` for both (1–30).
18. Print all numbers between 1–50 divisible by 3 or 5 but not both.
19. Reverse the string `"Machine Learning"` using loops only.
20. Print all numbers from 1–10 using a `while` loop.

## LEVEL 3 – COLLECTIONS AND NESTED LOOPS
21. Print each key and value from:
fruit_prices = {"apple": 100, "banana": 40, "cherry": 200}
22. Create a new list with squares of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` using a loop.
23. Print elements of `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]` one by one using nested loops.
24. Print all pairs `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i, j ≤ 3`.
25. Print this pattern:
*
**
***
****
*****
26. Print this inverted pattern:
*****
****
***
**
*
27. Print a multiplication table (1–5) using nested loops.
28. Print numbers in a 3x3 grid like:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
29. Count how many words in `"Machine learning is amazing"` have more than 6 letters.
30. Print all common elements of `[1,2,3,4,5]` and `[4,5,6,7,8]` using loops.

## LEVEL 4 – LOGIC AND LOOP APPLICATION
31. Reverse a number (e.g., `12345 → 54321`) using loops.
32. Sum digits of a number (e.g., `987 → 24`).
33. Check if a number is palindrome (e.g., `121`).
34. Generate Fibonacci sequence up to 100 using loops.
35. Print all numbers from 1–100 whose digit sum equals 10.
